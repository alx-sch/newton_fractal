## The Newton Fractal

The Newton Fractal is a type of fractal derived from **Newton's Method** for finding the roots (solutions) of a complex equation $f(z) = 0$. 

The fractal is generated by plotting the complex plane

$$
z_0 = \text{Re}(z_0) + i \cdot \text{Im}(z_0)
$$ 

where:  
- **Hue (Color)**: Determined by which of the $n$ roots the iteration converges to.
- **Brightness/Saturation**: Determined by the number of iterations it takes to converge.

#### Finding the Roots:
The equation $z^n = 1$ is solved by understanding that the number $1$ can be expressed in the complex exponential form using the identity:  

$$
1 = e^{i 2\pi k}
$$

This follows from **Euler’s Formula**

$$
\mathbf{e^{i \theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)}
$$

and the periodicity of sine and cosine, where $k$ is any integer representing full $2\pi$ rotations.

By setting the exponents equal and solving for $z$, we obtain the $n$ distinct roots of unity:

$$
z_k = \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi k}{n}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi k}{n}\right), \quad k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1
$$

#### The Iterative Process:

The iterative procedure of Newton’s method is defined as:

$$
z_{k+1} = z_k - \frac{f(z_k)}{f'(z_k)}
$$

The program runs this loop for a given starting complex number $z_0$, computing successive iterations $z_1, z_2, \dots$ until a convergence criterion is met — namely, when the distance between the current value $z_k$ ​and the nearest known root $r_i$ ​ becomes smaller than a tolerance $\epsilon$:

$$
|z_{k+1} - r_i| < \epsilon
$$

For $f(z) = z^n - 1$, the derivative is $f'(z) = n \cdot z^{n-1}$.

Substituting these into the Newton formula gives the specific iteration used in the implementation (and later parallelized in ISPC):

$$
z_{k+1} = z_k - \frac{z_k^n - 1}{n \cdot z_k^{n-1}}
$$

The **root index** ($i$) to which the iteration converges, together with the number of iterations required, determines the color of each pixel in the rendered image
